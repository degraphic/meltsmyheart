<h1>About the <?php echo getConfig()->get('site')->name; ?> Team</h1>
<p>
  We're a family of <em>three</em> that believed in a better way to share photos of our child. 
  We knew that other parents would jump at the chance to let their friends and family see their child growing up.
</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
  Jaisen, Rachel and <a href="http://tavin.meltsmyheart.com">Tavin</a> make up the team. 
  Jaisen is a software engineer by trade and handles all the technical details of the site.
  Rachel provides a much needed perspective of a new mom and blogs about motherhood.
  Tavin provided the original inspiration and continues to keep us motivated.
</p>

<h2>Why do we do it?</h2>
<p>
  Children and photos.
  We love them both.
  Jaisen previously co-founded a photo sharing startup in 2004 so it's a natural fit for him.
  Rachel loves to share photos of <a href="http://tavin.meltsmyheart.com">Tavin</a> and keep up with friends and family.
</p>

<h2>Plans for the future</h2>
<p>
  There are lots of features we have planned for the future.
  But no feature is as important as the ones our users ask for.
  If you have an idea or would like to see something just send us an email at <?php echo emailLink(); ?>.
  We'd love to hear from you.
